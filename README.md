# Semester Project No. 1 - PIC24 PROCESSOR VHDL

This repository contains the implementation of a simplified **24-bit PIC24-inspired processor**, written entirely in **VHDL**, developed as a semester project during year 3, semester 1.

The project represents a natural continuation and evolution of the **MIPS processor** designed and implemented during year 2, semester 2, within the **Computer Organization and Architecture course laboratories.**
While the MIPS processor was developed incrementally across multiple lab assignments, this PIC24 processor was designed as **a standalone semester project**, aiming to deepen understanding of processor architecture, instruction decoding, control logic, and hardware description using VHDL.
