# Semester Project No. 1 - PIC24 PROCESSOR VHDL

This repository contains the implementation of a simplified **24-bit PIC24-inspired processor**, written entirely in **VHDL**, developed as a semester project during year 3, semester 1.

The project represents a natural continuation and evolution of the **MIPS processor** designed and implemented during year 2, semester 2, within the **Computer Organization and Architecture course laboratories.**
While the MIPS processor was developed incrementally across multiple lab assignments, this PIC24 processor was designed as **a standalone semester project**, aiming to deepen understanding of processor architecture, instruction decoding, control logic, and hardware description using VHDL.



## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The main objectives of this project are :

- To **design and implement** a **custom 24-bit processor architecture**

- To **understand and model** the **internal structure of a PIC24-like CPU**

- To gain hands-on experience with :

  - instruction fetch, decode, and execution

  - **ALU operations** and flag handling

  - control unit design

  - program counter and **branching logic**

- To **validate processor functionality** through **simulation and testbenches**

- To integrate hardware (VHDL) with software-level testing (assembly code)
